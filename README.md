# Connect-4-game

The simulation of the game I used to play a lot during my childhood.

The input is given through command line with 4 arguments

eg: ./a.out 2 8 9 

means game is played between 2 players on 8 columns X 9 rows board.

./a.out 1 5 6 

means game is played between you and computer in 5 columns X 9 rows board. Here computer is not programmed to be smart.

The code handles wrong input.

After every move, the board is displayed and next player is asked to give input of column number. 

The game halts as soon as any player wins the game or the game goes TIE.
